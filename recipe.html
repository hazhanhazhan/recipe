        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter, oil, and brown sugar on medium speed until the mixture is pale and airy, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix to combine, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. The mixture should be fluffy and light in color.</li>
            <li>Alternate adding the flour mixture and the buttermilk, starting with half of the flour mixture, then all of the buttermilk, and finally the rest of the flour mixture. After each addition, mix on low speed just until combined. Pause and scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed to ensure even mixing. The batter should be smooth and look like a thick chocolate cake batter.</li>
            <li>Scoop the batter with a 1-ounce cookie scoop, or if you are not using a cookie scoop roughly 2 tablespoons of batter per cake round. Drop the batter onto the prepared baking sheets leaving about 2 inches or space between each cake.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through (you’ll need to bake the trays in batches). The tops of the cakes should look matte and spring back when gently poked. A toothpick inserted into the center of one of the middle cakes should come out clean or with only a few crumbs clinging to it.</li>
            <li>Let the cake cool on the trays for 5 minutes, then use a spatula to transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before filling them.</li>
            <li>While the cakes cool, make the filling. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer) beat the butter and confectioners’ sugar on medium speed until pale and satiny, about 2 minutes. Add the marshmallow creme and vanilla extract and continue mixing until smooth. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix again for 30 seconds to combine. The filling, while fluffy, will be slightly thicker than typical cake frosting</li>
            <li>When the cakes are completely cool, assemble the whoopie pies. Spread or scoop about 2 tablespoons of the filling on the flat side of half of the cakes. Sandwich a second cake over the top.</li>
            <li>Store the whoopie pies layered between sheets of wax paper or parchment paper in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
